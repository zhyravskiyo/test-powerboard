# Paydock Payment Connector

## Overview

The Paydock Payment Connector facilitates integration between commercetools and Paydock, allowing for efficient management of payment processes. This repository is divided into two main modules:

- **Extension Module**: Serves as middleware, linking commercetools with Paydock. Configured to trigger on payment creation or updates within commercetools, it ensures these events are appropriately handled by Paydock.

- **Notification Module**: Handles asynchronous notifications from Paydock regarding payment status changes (e.g., authorization, charge, refund). This module updates the corresponding payment status in commercetools.

Both modules are essential for the seamless integration of commercetools and Paydock.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites before proceeding with installation:

- Docker installed on your machine.
- An active commercetools account with API credentials.
- Git installed on your machine.

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/PayDock/e-commerce-commercetools-payment-connector
```


### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

#### For the Extension Module
Navigate to the extension directory and set up the environment variables:

```
cd e-commerce-commercetools-payment-connector/extension
echo 'PAYDOCK_INTEGRATION_CONFIG={
   "clientId":"[YOUR_CLIENT_ID]",
   "clientSecret":"[YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET]",
   "projectKey":"[YOUR_PROJECT_KEY]",
   "apiUrl":"https://api.[REGION_ID].gcp.commercetools.com",
   "authUrl":"https://auth.[REGION_ID].gcp.commercetools.com"
}' > .env
```


Replace the placeholder values with your actual Commercetools API credentials.


#### For the Notification Module
Navigate to the notification directory and set up the environment variables:

```
cd e-commerce-commercetools-payment-connector/notification
echo 'PAYDOCK_INTEGRATION_CONFIG={
   "clientId":"[YOUR_CLIENT_ID]",
   "clientSecret":"[YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET]",
   "projectKey":"[YOUR_PROJECT_KEY]",
   "apiUrl":"https://api.[REGION_ID].gcp.commercetools.com",
   "authUrl":"https://auth.[REGION_ID].gcp.commercetools.com"
}' > .env
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Commercetools API credentials.
